# DALL-E
This project integrates OpenAI's DALL-E with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to generate images from text prompts. Users can input text descriptions and get AI-generated images in real-time. It showcases how to build a full-stack web application that uses the power of AI to create dynamic content.

#Project Overview

Key features:

-Input text descriptions.
-Generate AI-based images using DALL-E API.
-View generated images in a gallery.
-Store generated images and their metadata in a database.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
